        "### **What is RNN?**\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer. The main and most important feature of RNN is Hidden state, which remembers some information about a sequence.\n",

        "### **How do we plan to use simpleRNN?**\n",

        "The architechture involves using a simpleRNN tensorflow layers on the embeddings and obtaining the predictions, which would try to attain a decent summarisation. Given it is a baseline, we outperform this model with all the other models we experiment with."

            "Training Text: \t\t sostok the next time youre around each guy make an effort to really engage him and to think about what it is you like about him so much though you cant always down the complicated feelings that make you like a person its important to have as much information as possible when you make such an important decision ask yourself the following questions when you talk to each guy does he make me laugh does he have a good sense of humor were all attracted to people who can make us laugh guys with a good sense of humor make us excited and cause us to look at the world in a different way if he you is it weird or do you like it no guy should touch you in the obvious places unless you are ready for that but like a hug around the waist holding hands or even his arm around you is okay but if youre at the stage where he is going to kiss you and you kiss him back make sure that you are ready to be at that stage when he kisses you be sure you know how to kiss you dont want it to be awkward the guy you are going to choose needs to be able to himself does he seem curious about other people is he interested in things outside himself guys who are only interested in themselves can be pretty boring youll want a guy who has hobbies friends and a good perspective on life is he in touch with his emotional side is he sensitive about other people lots of guys have an emotional side the problem is they dont want other people to see it a guy whos okay with other people seeing his emotions is a guy whos both confident and mature does he flirt respectfully basically the ask question down to this does it seem like he likes you for more than just your body or just your looks are the compliments he gives you more than just about your body does he take things slow guys who take things slow like to things they care about getting every last drop of out of being around you guys who are moving at the speed of light are often onto the next girl faster than you can say this is just as important as thinking about what you like about each guy one guy may look better on paper and may have all of the qualities that youre looking for but the other guy may have the ability to make your heart just by sending you a text message so the next time youre around each guy think not only about why you like him but ask yourself if he makes you feel confident happy giddy and like a better person here are some things to consider how does he make you feel when youre around him does he make you feel like hes only interested in you or does he seem like he flirts with other girls all the time and youre just another girl on his long list does he bring out the best in you or is he okay with you just being okay does he challenge you and make you want to be a better person does he compliment you in a way that is meaningful and not forced does he make you blush giggle and feel like a giddy little girl does he treat you like a lady and make you feel special though you may only be thinking about all of the great qualities of both guys and about how they both give you butterflies you should also consider the negative aspects of their personality or lifestyle to get more clarification if youre serious about making this choice then you have to consider the pros and the cons of being with each guy here are some things to consider as you make your decision does the guy have a lot of does he have a complicated past and a of emotional issues to deal with sure you may have fun with him but is that something you want to be responsible for in the long run is he and manipulative does he always try to get his way or is he of admitting hes wrong these are serious signs that hes probably a little and signs that you might get more than you for in a relationship has he to you you want a guy that you can trust a guy whos not afraid to be honest with you regardless of how much the truth hurts guys who like gossiping and starting rumors probably dont care much about other people meaning stay away from him does he constantly get in trouble either at school with his parents or with the authorities bad boys may have a certain about them but chances are if theyre constantly distracted with or they wont have any time to be around you does he still talk about his exgirlfriend if hes still talking about his ex dropping in little hints from time to time or constantly talking about her thats a bad sign it doesnt mean that hes a bad guy it just means that he still loves her if both guys are completely to you then you have a tough task on your hands though you shouldnt go with the guy who likes you more just because its a safer choice you should consider how important you are to each guy and what it would mean to him if you stopped seeing him if he would just shrug it off and then move on to the next girl then hes not the guy for you if you think one of the guys likes you much more than the other then this should play a strong part in your decision you dont have to ask outright you can get a sense of how much guy feels about you just by the way he looks at you by how often he wants to hang out and by how much he talks about a future together of course if youre just looking to have fun with a summer fling or to get some dating experience for a few months then you dont have to care so much about whether the guy sees you as long term potential your friends are there for a reason they offer shoulders to lean on provide examples of how to behave and give you advice when you need it take their advice but with a grain of salt youre making the decision at the end of the day remember that youre not asking them to help you pick the better guy or the guy that they would pick but that you want them to help you decide whats right for you dont ask who do you like better ask who do you think is better for me these questions will keep you from getting suggestions about who your friends would date instead of who you should date be open to their suggestions if you have your mind made up about who you want to date theres no use in asking your friends about their opinion if you ask them for their input be ready to follow it this will help you see what you really wanted in the first place how does each one make you feel make a list of what you really want in a guy and dont do a about each guys strengths and weaknesses see how this lines up with the list of what you want out of a guy here are some other questions you can ask which guy will treat me better which guy will be there for me through the tough times which guy do i have more in common with which guys face will i always want to see at the end of the day which guy will get along better with my friends and family which guy can i not live without we cant pick and choose who we like were born a certain way and we eventually develop likes and dislikes dont overthink things trust what your gut tells you about these guys and go for it flip a in the air tell yourself that if it on heads you have to go with guy a and if it on tails you have to go with guy b while the is in the air where do you want it to land thats your answer if you know one guy is bad for you but cant help feeling attracted to him and dont really like the other guy take a break from both guys not being in a relationship really isnt bad in fact its much better than being learn from your mistakes if youve dated a certain guy before and the relationship ended poorly dont make the same mistake all over again with another guy even if you feel attracted to him whats the use in going through the same thing all over again if it caused you heartbreak and dont feel like you need to make a decision right away your decision could take some time during that time hopefully one of the guys will do something good or bad to make the decision much easier for you as long as you havent committed to either guy and dont feel like youre being to one guy by hanging out with the other then you should take some time to make the decision just dont drag it on too long if you pick one guy but he finds out that youve been hanging out with another guy for the last few months then he may feel hurt or once youve made your decision stick to it that doesnt mean you have to tell the guy hey i you over guy a that wont make the guy feel very special the commitment is something you make through your actions and your heart work on building a healthy stable relationship with the guy youve chosen and only the guy youve chosen get ready to start dating and hanging out with only the guy youve chosen enjoy the benefits of being with one person without wondering what another guy is up to if you feel empty or without the other guy then it may either mean that you made the wrong decision or that you never liked the first guy that much in the first place you only liked the chase be friendly to the other guy but dont go out of your way to hang out with him or do stuff alone together if youre overly friendly with him he might think that he still has a chance plus it might get the guy you jealous know that choosing between two guys will affect your relationship with both of them this is the of relationships chances are good that youre going to break the other guys heart and miss out on a relationship with him if the guy you dont choose doesnt know about the first guy you dont have to make it a big deal or give him the real reason why youre ending your relationship though you should be happy once youve made your decision know that the may still be a bit know that you may turn guys against each other what if both guys are best friends what do you do then if you choose one and the other likes you theyll probably stop being best friends if you want to avoid this situation altogether date someone else instead be prepared to lose the guy that you didnt choose he may not want to be just friends after you hung out romantically or flirted with each other but that may be for the best life is yours to live and you deserve to live it the way you want while trying to hurt others as little as possible though you may feel guilty for making the decision you and the two guys are better off once youve come to terms with your feelings be proud of yourself for making a mature choice instead of leading two guys on forever dont be afraid of making mistakes as long as you learn from them dont worry about having everyone like you when youre making a big decision like this feelings will get hurt eostok\n",

            "Training Text: \t\t sostok how do you really feel about your friend perhaps youre just interested in getting to know them a little better or maybe youve found that youre attracted to them and want to get to know them from a different perspective feelings are often confusing things make sure youve out exactly how you feel and what you want before you try taking things to the next if youre attracted to your friend you may decide that its to take things slowly and if the two of you are already close think about the kind of vibes you get from your friend are the two of you close or do you just hang out with the same group of people do they laugh at your jokes and show an interest in what you have to say when youre talking try to gauge your friends feeling as as you can if its obvious that theres no real attraction being reciprocated it might be best to hold off on asking them out if they act towards you however they may have similar feelings and might have even hoped youd ask if you have another friend that knows the friend in question and you feel comfortable talking to them about the situation ask their thoughts on how you should proceed they probably know something you dont one way or the other or have unique into the matter that might not have to you your other friends will eventually find out if youre dating so dont make it look like you were keeping it a secret from them if your other friends learn how you feel they may subtly talk to the friend you like the process keep in mind that your other friends are affected by whether or not you start dating while this shouldnt necessarily prevent you from asking a friend out show enough respect to be about your relationship with that friend and what consequences it might have the next time your group of friends is hanging out look for opportunities to pair up or spend some time alone with the friend that you like this could be playing a game of pool together having a thoughtful oneonone conversation at a party or standing next to each other at a concert get comfortable with the idea of being alone with your friend and try to also get a sense of how they feel about it in these moments if your friend to you during future hangouts its probably a good out your attention to your friends take an opportunity to spend time alone with your friend if one but dont make them feel forced to split off and ignore the rest of your company dont expect too much to happen too soon if at all even if your friend likes you back they may be reluctant to do anything that might jeopardize the relationship that the two of you currently have whatever your friend decides you should be okay with it if you get too set on the idea of dating it may come as a disappointment if your friend declines which could create distance between the two of you as to take no for an answer if your friend agrees to spend time with you oneonone but makes it known that theyre uneasy with the dating label accept their position and plan to find something casual to do put whatever they have about your friendship to rest by them that youll remain friends regardless of how things turn out you should be taking your friends feelings into consideration as well as your own if theyve been giving you flirtatious signals it might be a clue that theyre interested in you and will agree to a date if they seem disinterested or youre having trouble reading their feelings they may be uncomfortable with the idea recognizing the appropriate point to ask a friend on a date will most often come down to personal probably better not to ask your friend out in a group setting where they may feel pressure to respond in a certain way the best way to ask someone on a date in most circumstances is facetoface however since you and your friend already have an established platonic relationship asking them out directly may be awkward or make them feel pressured weigh your options a friendly phone call might do it or you could drop the during a text conversation your friend will probably be most to the idea of going on a date if it doesnt feel like a big deal so dont make it about how your friend does most of their communicating and go with their that way nothing feels off when it comes time to the subject once youve determined how youre going to ask work the offer naturally into a conversation with your friend or be collected and upfront about it the two of you are already friends so there should be a mutual degree of respect and comfort in place frame the question in a way that that the decision is theirs and that you want to remain friends either might be easiest to suggest that just the two of you do something together as friends sometime since this will cause no initial concern of changing the nature of the relationship if your desire is to continue dating as more than friends though make sure youre your intentions honestly if your friend declines your offer smile and carry on in an manner he or she will likely be worried about the friendship if they turn you down make sure that they know youre still happy to be their friend its possible that the time just wasnt right but now that your friend is aware of your feelings they may in time discover that theyre attracted to you as well no matter how things progress between you your friendship is the foundation of your relationship and the most important thing this thought should feel like a safety for you when youre the nerve to ask your friend out if its not what your friend wants or theyre not yet open to the possibility youll have your friendship to fall back on and you should a true friend will understand and be there to make sure everything is okay even if you start dating and things are going well dont forget that they were your friend first the comfort of that bond will make your connection even stronger try to think of your new relationship as a of your friendship not a for it all of your interactions should come from a place of caring and acceptance theres no reason for the friendship to suffer simply because youre trying to build on it dating a friend can sometimes cause complications if you tend to hang around the same people be upfront with your other friends about the situation and let them know that it wont alter the friendship of the group take particular care not to isolate yourselves when youre with your mutual friends this can be easy to do when you first begin to date someone but it might give the rest of your friends the impression that youre disinterested in them since you as friends work on an environment where you can still spend time together even when youre involved with some time each week for all of your friends to get together during this time involve yourself in the groups activities and discussions and dont make it feel like you and the friend you like are yourselves from the rest of your friends if your dating efforts arent met with success dont let it come between you and your friend you knew to keep your expectations out of the picture so theres no need to take it too hard not wanting to date may just mean that he or she values you very highly as a friend which is a good thing theres no harm in liking someone and you shouldnt feel awkward or guilty if you tried and things didnt work out in the worst case scenario you can simply go back to being friends its a shouldnt be embarrassed or feel the need to punish your friend if things dont work from your friend group will make you appear and may send the message that you were only looking to date the person from the beginning allowing resentment to build up will take its on your friendship which is precisely what you dont want to happen whether you hit it off on your date or you dont take pleasure in being around one another starting off as friends means you already know you have common interests can communicate openly and like spending time together look at it as a chance to spend some quality time with the person with no thought to the outcome do things that you both enjoy and the occasion to make new experiences and memories with the
